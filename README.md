This repo contains my Python data analysis projects. I carry out the analysis in Jupiter notebook with <b>Pandas</b>, <b>NumPy</b>, and <b>GeoPandas</b>, and accompany it with visualizations made in <b>Matplotlib</b>, <b>Seaborn</b> and <b>Plotly</b>.
If I create a dataset for analysis myself, I describe all steps of its creation in an additional notebook.
Interactive vizzes make notebooks heavy, so they are best viewed through NBViewer.

| <b>Russian Regional Money Flows Analysis</b> | Huge imbalances exist between the Russian regions in terms of how much money they give or take from the federal center (the so-called "snickering" Moscow), as well as in terms of the income and perspectives of their dwellers. I use my newly created regional budget dataset to explore these imbalances. | 19-11-2023 | EDA, Time series, Geospatial, Visualization | [Link](https://nbviewer.org/github/lomska/Data-Analysis-Python/blob/main/Russian-Regional-Money-Analysis/Russian_Regional_Money_Analysis.ipynb) |
